  abstract  = {Document stores that provide the efficiency of a schema-less interface are widely used by developers in mobile and cloud applications. However, the simplicity developers achieved controversially leads to complexity for data management due to lack of a schema. In this paper, we present a schema management framework for document stores. This framework discovers and persists schemas of JSON records in a repository, and also supports queries and schema summarization. The major technical challenge comes from varied structures of records caused by the schema-less data model and schema evolution. In the discovery phase, we apply a canonical form based method and propose an algorithm based on equivalent sub-trees to group equivalent schemas efficiently. Together with the algorithm, we propose a new data structure, eSiBu-Tree, to store schemas and support queries. In order to present a single summarized representation for heterogenous schemas in records, we introduce the concept of "skeleton", and propose to use it as a relaxed form of the schema, which captures a small set of core attributes. Finally, extensive experiments based on real data sets demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed schema discovery algorithms, and practical use cases in real-world data exploration and integration scenarios are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of using skeletons in these applications.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, we examine a number of SQL and socalled "NoSQL" data stores designed to scale simple OLTP-style application loads over many servers. Originally motivated by Web 2.0 applications, these systems are designed to scale to thousands or millions of users doing updates as well as reads, in contrast to traditional DBMSs and data warehouses. We contrast the new systems on their data model, consistency mechanisms, storage mechanisms, durability guarantees, availability, query support, and other dimensions. These systems typically sacrifice some of these dimensions, e.g. database-wide transaction consistency, in order to achieve others, e.g. higher availability and scalability.},

  abstract  = {User profile integration from multiple social networks is indispensable for gaining a comprehensive view on users. Although current social networks provide access to user profile data via dedicated APIs, they fail to provide accurate schema information, which aggravates the integration of user profiles, and not least the adaptation of applications in the face of schema evolution. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents, firstly, a semi-automatic approach to extract schema information from instance data. Secondly, transformations of the derived schemas to different technical spaces are utilized, thereby allowing, amongst other benefits, the application of established integration tools and methods. Finally, as a case study, schemas are derived for Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. The resulting schemas are analyzed (i) for completeness and correctness according to the documentation, and (ii) for semantic overlaps and heterogeneities amongst each other, building the basis for future user profile integration.},
