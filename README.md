# Reproduction Study at the Course Reproducibility Engineering at the University of Passau

## Overview

This repository contains the work for a reproduction study conducted as part of the Reproducibility Engineering course at the University of Passau. The study focuses on replicating the research and experiments detailed in "An Approach for Schema Extraction of JSON and Extended JSON Document Collections".

## Original Study

The original study presented a methodology for schema discovery in NoSQL databases, specifically targeting JSON and Extended JSON documents. Key findings and methodologies of the original paper are revisited and critically evaluated in this reproduction attempt.

## Reproduction Objective

The aim of this reproduction study is to validate the findings of the original paper, specifically focusing on the processing time evaluation of the JSON Schema Discovery approach. This involves replicating the original experiments and comparing the outcomes.
